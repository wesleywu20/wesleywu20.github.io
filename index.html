                    Welcome to my digital domain!
                    <p>
                    I'm a second-year MS ECE student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a specialization in computer architecture targeting networking systems. I'm currently a researcher in the <a href="https://fast.ece.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAST Lab</a>, working on enabling <a href="https://p4.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P4</a> programmability on an <a href="https://fast.ece.illinois.edu/projects/2_project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPGA-based PCIe Switch</a> under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/nskim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nam Sung Kim</a>. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Throughout my time as a masters student, I've had the honor of completing two internships at Arm, where I contributed to SoC post-silicon validation tooling infrastructure and design verification efforts on Arm's <a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-system/corelink-interconnect/nic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoreLink Interconnect</a>. Both experiences were invaluable in solidifying my understanding of industry-level computer architecture and further fueling my passion for the field.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  At Arm, I've had the privilege of completing two internships, one in SoC post-silicon validation tooling infrastructure and another in design verification on the System IP team. In my internship with the SoC Validation Team, I worked under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashantmishra10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prashant Mishra</a> and management of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-eidson-72757b6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Eidson</a>. In my internship with the System IP team, I worked under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohit-sardesai-47b81b8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rohit Sardesai</a> and management of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kschan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenny Chan</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my first internship, I worked on developing a Python-based API for remote control of <a href="https://www.chromaus.com/thermal-systems/cobra-thermal-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chroma Cobra</a> temperature forcing systems, which are used in many post-silicon validation labs to test SoC performance at various operating temperatures. The main feature of the API was a Python tkinter-based GUI which allowed engineers to easily manage and monitor the thermal systems remotely, improving efficiency and reducing the need for physical presence in the lab. In addition, I created a custom Python library to interface with the Chroma Cobra systems, enabling automated control for batch testing scenarios. As the post-silicon lab was relatively new and still establishing their bases, I also made the API future-proof by providing a framework for adding support for other temperature systems in the future along with detailed documentation to facilitate easy adoption by the team. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my second internship, I contributed to the design verification of Arm's <a href="https://www.arm.com/products/silicon-ip-system/corelink-interconnect/nic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CoreLink Interconnect</a> using SystemVerilog and UVM methodologies. I was mainly responsible for tracing and resolving bugs in the RTL design of and testbench used to verify a crucial block in the interconnect. 
                </p>
                <p>  
                  When I wasn't contributing to direct verification of the interconnect itself, I was working towards enabling <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/verification/simulation/vcs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synopsys VCS</a> simulator as a secondary option, as the System IP team primarily uses <a href="https://resources.sw.siemens.com/en-US/fact-sheet-questasim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siemens/Mentor QuestaSim</a> for their verification. This involved ensuring that all existing tests in the testbench were compatible with VCS and debugging any issues that arose during compile and simulation. I was even rewarded for my efforts on the simulation tooling infrastructure, as another verification engineer was able to catch a bug using VCS that was previously undetected using QuestaSim.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both internships at Arm provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in the semiconductor industry, allowing me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with talented professionals and contribute to cutting-edge technology development. I'm very excited to return to Arm next winter for a full-time position on the System IP team, where I will work on RTL design for new features on a core component of the CoreLink Interconnect!

                <h2 class="mb-4">Qualcomm</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  At Qualcomm, I've had the privilege of getting my first hands-on experience in pre-silicon chip design and working on a DV project under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexvalenciagt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Valencia</a> and management of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/surendran-subramanian-188a3861/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suren Surbramanian</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/santoshkumar9891/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santosh Kumar</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my time at Qualcomm, I mainly worked on implementing a functional coverage model for the application processor sub-system of a future mobile SoC, allowing for the SoC Integration DV team to ensure high verification quality during integration. I added this model to an already existing special functional coverage framework spearheaded by two of my co-workers which significantly cuts down on coverage collection time across simulation, emulation, and prototyping platforms simultaneously. To complement this functional coverage model, I also wrote a Cadence vPlan to indicate to the DV engineers which bins were of more importance to cover in the verification tests. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  As this was my first exploration into the realm of hardware, I learned a great deal about what industry tools and methodologies are used in the process of design verification, especially UVM. In addition, since I spent the duration of the summer working on the application processor sub-system of the SoC, I naturally ended up discovering the complexity behind SoC designs, despite how small of a package they come in, and also learning what sub-systems work together on the chips in the phones we use everyday. This internship brought me one step closer to reaching my goal of being able to say I contributed to the development of something that's used in everyday products.

                <p class="mb-4">
                  At Motorola Solutions, I've had the pleasure of working on Android bootloader security for Motorola's <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/products/two-way-radios/project-25-radios/portable-radios/apx-next.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">APX NEXT</a> software-defined radio under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donghuayan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donghua Yan</a> and management of Prabhakar Kesava for both an internship and part-time co-op. I used C to implement most of the features.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One core feature of the bootloader which I implemented was image preflash validation for different binary image formats. This validation was a crucial step to prevent device corruption should it fall into the wrong hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another critical feature I implemented was a dump function, which allows developers to retrieve binary image data straight from the virtual partitions on the device in case the device gets corrupted. It wasn't possible before to view the binary image data from a corrupted partition, and this feature enables the developers to manually check through the image data to find the source of corruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to these features, I've also implemented several more to enhance the bootloader's security, and through my time at Motorola Solutions I am thankful to have gained valuable experience in embedded software development in C.
