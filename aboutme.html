    <h2 style = "text-align: left; font-size: 24px;">Why Did I Choose Computer Engineering?</h2>
    <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">
        Computers. We use them every day. You (might be) using one to read this website. I am using one to develop this website. But, how exactly do they work their magic behind-the-box?<br>
        Quite simply, that is what I hope to extract from my B.S. in Computer Engineering at UIUC and have already begun to discover throughout my coursework thus far.<br>
        In addition, with this knowledge, I hope I can one day make my own contributions to advancements in computing with a specialization in computer architecture.

    <h3 style = "text-align: left; font-size: 24px;">My Career Path</h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">
        Well, one thing I can tell you right now is I <i>know</i> how to use a computer. Like, <b>really well.</b> I mean, how else would I have developed this website, right?<br>
        Jokes aside, though, I began learning programming in high school, starting with Python, then graduating to Java.<br>
        After arriving at UIUC, my freshman-year coursework began introducing me to computing/how comptuers work, starting from the most basic building block of computers - bits and bytes.<br>
        Then, we gradually built on top of bits & bytes to work towards logic building blocks, then assembly coding, then C/C++ programming.<br>
        This past semester, I took a course on computer architecture, of which I found the content I learned to be really fascinating, and the assignments enhanced my learning experience even more! <br>
        Alongside the computer architecture course, I also took a course in CUDA programming, which also presented some really interesting ideas in parallelism in the software realm, but there were also compelling connections to the hardware realm which were necessary to understanding the parallelism too! <br> 
        I also took a course in digital circuit design 2 semesters ago, which directly precedes the course introducing computing.<br>
        And even after that, UIUC offers even more amazing courses, SoC design, and more!<br>
        <br>
        In addition to the spectacular courses UIUC offers, I also have spent time contributing to multiple projects, spanning the realms of both software <i>and</i> hardware.<br>
        I've provided links to all the projects I've contributed to on my landing page, but should you wish to be reminded of my achievements, my projects are:<br>
        A Pipelined Implementation of A RV32I Processor, An FPGA crossword (hardware), A CUDA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and an IoT Water System (firmware).<br>
        Feel free to check them out using the links under the 'Projects' dropdown button!<br>
        <br>
        With these projects under my belt, I was able to land an internship for summer of 2022 working as an Android Platform Software Engineering Intern @ Motorola Solutions.<br>
        At the internship, I learned quite a lot about Android, mostly specialized knowledge about the Android bootloader - the entire internship really exceeded my expectations!<br>
        I felt that the role of 'Software Engineering Intern' was quite misleading, as I was actually assigned to do firmware, but nonetheless, it has been a really fulfilling experience!
    </p>
    <h4 style = "text-align: left; font-size: 24px;">Looking ahead</h4>
    <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">
        Next summer, I'm hoping that after taking more hardware electives (especially computer organization and design) that I can land myself a hardware internship role.<br>
        Ideally, I'm aiming for an FPGA or digital circuit design type role, and I've received a return offer from Motorola Solutions in case I can't get a hardware role.<br>
        I am, of course, also applying to more software roles as backups.<br>
        I also plan to pursue an M.S. in computer architecture, with UIUC being one of my target schools, and I'm currently compiling a list of other schools I'd like to apply to. <br>
