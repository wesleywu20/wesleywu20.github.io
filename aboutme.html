    <h2 style = "text-align: left">Why Did I Choose Computer Engineering?</h2>
    <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 30;">
        Computers. We use them every day. You (might be) using one to read this website. I am using one to develop this website. But, how exactly do they work their magic behind-the-box?<br>
        Quite simply, that is what I hope to extract from my B.S. in Computer Engineering at UIUC and have already begun to discover throughout my coursework thus far.<br>
        In addition, with this knowledge, I hope I can one day make my own contributions to advancements in computing with a specialization in computer architecture.

    <h3 style = "text-align: left;">My Career Path</h3>
    <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 30;">
        Well, one thing I can tell you right now is I <i>know</i> how to use a computer. Like, <b>really well.</b> I mean, how else would I have developed this website, right?<br>
        Jokes aside, though, I began learning programming in high school, starting with Python, then graduating to Java.<br>
        After arriving at UIUC, my freshman-year coursework began introducing me to computing/how comptuers work, starting from the most basic building block of computers - bits and bytes.<br>
        Then, we gradually built on top of bits & bytes to work towards logic building blocks, then assembly coding, then C/C++ programming.<br>
        I recently took a course in digital circuit design, which directly precedes the course introducing computing.<br>
        And even after that, UIUC offers even more amazing courses, including courses on computer organization and design, SoC design, and more!<br>
        <br>
        In addition to the spectacular courses UIUC offers, I also have spent time contributing to multiple projects, spanning the realms of both software <i>and</i> hardware.<br>
        I've provided links to all the cool stuff I've done on my landing page, but should you wish to be reminded of my grand achievements, my projects are:<br>
        An FPGA crossword (hardware), a hardware version of Wordle (firmare), a board Game recommendation system (software), and an IoT Water System (firmware).<br>
        Feel free to check them out using the links under the 'Projects' dropdown button!<br>
        <br>
        With these projects under my belt, I was able to land an internship for summer of 2022 working as an Android Platform Software Engineering Intern @ Motorola Solutions.<br>
        At the internship, I learned quite a lot about Android, mostly specialized knowledge about the Android bootloader - the entire internship really exceeded my expectations!<br>
        I felt that the role of 'Software Engineering Intern' was quite misleading, as I was actually assigned to do firmware, but nonetheless, it has been a really fulfilling experience!
    </p>
    <h4 style = "text-align: left;">Looking ahead</h4>
    <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 30;">
        Next summer, I'm hoping that after taking more hardware electives that I can land myself a hardware internship role.<br>
        Ideally, I'm aiming for an FPGA or digital circuit design type role, and I'm aiming to get a return offer from Motorola Solutions in case I can't get a hardware role.<br>
        I am, of course, also applying to more software roles as backups.<br>
        <br>
        I also plan to pursue an M.S. in computer architecture, but I have not decided any of my target schools just yet!
